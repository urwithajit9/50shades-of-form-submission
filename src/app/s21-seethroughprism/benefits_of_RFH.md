## **ðŸ”¹ Key Benefits of Using `react-hook-form` with Zustand and Zod**
### âœ… **1. Improved Performance (Fewer Re-renders)**
- `react-hook-form` is optimized to work without causing excessive re-renders. Unlike `useState`, which updates the component on every keystroke, `react-hook-form` **tracks field state without re-rendering** the entire component.

### âœ… **2. Simplified Validation Handling (Native Zod Integration)**
- Instead of manually calling `formSchema.safeParse()`, `react-hook-form` **integrates directly with Zod** using the `zodResolver`, automatically validating inputs when they change.

### âœ… **3. Better Form Control & Flexibility**
- `react-hook-form` allows **better control over form fields** using `register`, `handleSubmit`, and `formState`. This makes handling inputs easier than manually binding `onChange` events.

### âœ… **4. Simplifies Error Handling**
- With `formState.errors`, you get **real-time validation messages** instead of manually setting errors inside Zustand.

### âœ… **5. Supports Uncontrolled Components**
- Unlike Zustand, which works best with controlled components, `react-hook-form` can manage **uncontrolled components**, which perform better by reducing unnecessary state updates.
