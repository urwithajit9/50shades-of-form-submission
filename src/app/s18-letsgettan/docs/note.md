When you move the call to `updateField` from every input’s onChange to inside the onSubmit handler, you change when the global (Zustand) state is synchronized with the form values. Here’s a comparison of the two approaches:

---

## **Approach 1: Updating on Each onChange**

- **How It Works:**
  With this approach, you combine react-hook-form’s onChange handler with your custom `updateField` function. Every time a user types in a field, two things happen:

  1. **React Hook Form** immediately updates its internal state and triggers validation.
  2. **Zustand** is updated with the new value in real time.

- **Benefits:**

  - **Live Synchronization:** The global store is always in sync with the latest user input. This is useful if other parts of your application rely on the current form values (e.g., for a live preview).
  - **Instant Feedback:** If you use the Zustand errors or values elsewhere in the UI, they’re updated immediately as the user types.

- **Potential Drawbacks:**
  - **Performance Considerations:** For very large forms or when many components depend on the global state, updating on every keystroke might lead to extra renders.
  - **Complexity:** You must ensure that the combined onChange correctly calls both handlers without interfering with react-hook-form’s built‑in validation.

## **Approach 2: Updating Only on onSubmit**

- **How It Works:**
  In this scenario, react-hook-form is the sole “source of truth” during editing. The form data remains managed locally by react-hook-form. Only when the user submits the form do you take the validated data and update the Zustand store by calling `updateField` for each field (or by using the data directly in your store’s `submitForm`).

  Example:

  ```tsx
  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FormData> = async (data) => {
    console.log("Validated data from react-hook-form:", data);
    try {
      // Update Zustand store with final validated data
      await updateField("name", data.name);
      await updateField("email", data.email);
      // ... update other fields similarly

      // Then call submitForm from the store
      await submitForm(data);
      reset(); // Reset local RHF state
      resetForm(); // Reset global Zustand state
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(
        "Submission error, form data retained for correction.",
        error
      );
      // Errors are handled (e.g., displayed) but the global state remains updated with the submitted values
    }
  };
  ```

- **Benefits:**

  - **Simplicity:** You rely on react-hook-form for all real-time updates and validation during editing. The global store is updated only once at submission.
  - **Reduced Renders:** Because you’re not updating the global state on every keystroke, you avoid the potential overhead of frequent store updates.
  - **Clear Separation:** React-hook-form is solely responsible for live form state and validation, and Zustand only reflects the final (validated) data for submission and global state management.

- **Potential Drawbacks:**
  - **No Live Sync:** The global state (in Zustand) won’t reflect the user’s current input until submission. If other components depend on the global state, they won’t see the changes as they’re being made.
  - **Delayed Error Reporting:** Any errors from server submission (or additional global validations) will only be reflected after the user submits the form.

## **Which One to Choose?**

- **If you need immediate, real-time synchronization** of form values with other parts of your application (or a live preview, etc.), then updating on each onChange is beneficial.
- **If you only need the global state for submission or for storing final values,** and you want to minimize unnecessary global state updates, then updating onSubmit is a simpler and more performant approach.

In many cases, using react-hook-form as the source of truth during editing—and updating global state only upon submission—can be sufficient and easier to manage. This approach reduces the frequency of global state updates while still ensuring that the final, validated data is stored globally before you submit it.

## **Summary**

- **OnChange Update:**

  - **Pros:** Live sync, instant feedback, useful for dependent components.
  - **Cons:** Potential performance overhead, more complex integration.

- **OnSubmit Update:**
  - **Pros:** Simplicity, less frequent global state updates, clear separation between local and global state.
  - **Cons:** Global state isn’t updated in real time; only updated upon form submission.

Choose the approach that best fits your application’s needs. If real-time synchronization is not required, updating the global state on form submission (Approach 2) is typically simpler and more efficient.
